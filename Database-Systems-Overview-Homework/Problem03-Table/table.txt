Database Table

A table is a collection of related data held in a structured format within a database. It consists of fields (columns),
and rows. In relational databases, a table is a set of data elements (values) using a model of vertical columns
(which are identified by their name) and horizontal rows, the cell being the unit where a row and column intersect.
A table has a specified number of columns, but can have any number of rows. Each row is identified by one or more values
appearing in a particular column subset. The columns subset which uniquely identifies a row is called the primary key.

In terms of the relational model of databases, a table can be considered a convenient representation of a relation, 
but the two are not strictly equivalent. For instance, an SQL table can potentially contain duplicate rows, 
whereas a true relation cannot contain duplicate tuples. Similarly, representation as a table implies a particular 
ordering to the rows and columns, whereas a relation is explicitly unordered.
