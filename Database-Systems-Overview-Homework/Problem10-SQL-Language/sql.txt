SQL language

SQL is a special-purpose programming language designed for managing data held in a 
relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing 
in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS).
Originally based upon relational algebra and tuple relational calculus, SQL consists of a data definition 
language and a data manipulation language. The scope of SQL includes data insert, query, update and delete, schema 
creation and modification, and data access control. Although SQL is often described as, and to a great extent is, a 
declarative language, it also includes procedural elements.

Example query:

SELECT d.Name, e.JobTitle, MIN(e.Salary), e.FirstName FROM Employees e
JOIN Departments d ON e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID
GROUP BY d.Name, e.JobTitle, e.FirstName
