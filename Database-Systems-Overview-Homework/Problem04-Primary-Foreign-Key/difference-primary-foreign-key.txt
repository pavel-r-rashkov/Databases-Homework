Primary and foreign key

Primary key is a column of the table that uniquely identifies its rows (usually it is a number).
Two records (rows) are different if and only if their primary keys are different.

A foreign key is a field (or collection of fields) in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table.
In simpler words, the foreign key is defined in a second table, but it refers to the primary key in the first table.
The table containing the foreign key is called the child table, and the table containing the 
candidate key is called the referenced or parent table.
