Normalization

Database normalization is the process of organizing the attributes and tables of a relational database to minimize 
data redundancy.
Normalization involves decomposing a table into less redundant (and smaller) tables but without losing information.
Defining foreign keys in the old table referencing the primary keys of the new ones. The objective is to isolate data 
so that additions, deletions, and modifications of an attribute can be made in just one table and then propagated 
through the rest of the database using the defined foreign keys.

Normalization forms:

First normal form
First normal form deals with the "shape" of a record type.
Under first normal form, all occurrences of a record type must contain the same number of fields.

Second normal form
Second and third normal forms deal with the relationship between non-key and key fields.
Under second and third normal forms, a non-key field must provide a fact about the key, us the whole key,
and nothing but the key. In addition, the record must satisfy first normal form.

Third normal form
Third normal form is violated when a non-key field is a fact about another non-key field.

Fourth normal form
Under fourth normal form, a record type should not contain two or more independent multi-valued facts about an entity.
In addition, the record must satisfy third normal form.

Fifth normal form
Fifth normal form deals with cases where information can be reconstructed from smaller pieces of information that 
can be maintained with less redundancy. Second, third, and fourth normal forms also serve this purpose,
but fifth normal form generalizes to cases not covered by the others.
