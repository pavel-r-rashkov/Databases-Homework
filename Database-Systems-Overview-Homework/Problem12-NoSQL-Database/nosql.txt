NoSQL databases

A NoSQL database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is 
modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases.
Motivations for this approach include simplicity of design, horizontal scaling, and finer control over availability.
The data structures used by NoSQL databases (e.g. key-value, graph, or document) differ from those used
in relational databases, making some operations faster in NoSQL and others faster in relational databases.
The particular suitability of a given NoSQL database depends on the problem it must solve.
NoSQL databases are increasingly used in big data and real-time web applications. NoSQL systems are also 
called "Not only SQL" to emphasize that they may also support SQL-like query languages.

NoSQL database examples:

- MongoDB - document model
- CouchDB - document model
- Redis - key-value model 
- Cassandra - wide-column model 
- Cache - object model
