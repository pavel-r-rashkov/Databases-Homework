Document model

A document-oriented database is designed for storing, retrieving, and managing document-oriented information,
also known as semi-structured data. Document-oriented databases are inherently a subclass of the key-value store,
another NoSQL database concept. The difference lies in the way the data is processed - in a key-value store the data
is considered to be inherently opaque to the database, whereas a document-oriented system relies on internal
structure in the document order to extract metadata that the database engine uses for further optimization.
Although the difference is often moot due to tools in the systems, conceptually the document-store is designed to
offer a richer experience with modern programming techniques.
